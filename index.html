                <h2>A computer science student at IPB University.</h2>
                <p>I'm Samuel Christian. Since early high school, I've been trying to learn programming,
                    firstly introduced by a <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LZojgpkb-E">YouTube video</a></b>
                    <i>(btw not a fan of his stuff anymore..)</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've leaned quite a bit of coding stuff in college, but game programming is the only kind of
                    programming that I enjoy doing (not a pro by any mean).. and also I hate html (tbf it's not even a programming language).
